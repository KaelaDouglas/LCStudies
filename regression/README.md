## Overview

This directory contains some notebooks and code for regression of topo-cluster energies. Some neural network layers and models are defined in `layers.py` and `models.py`, respectively.

The `Models` directory contains some subdirectories, that correspond to different training data choices -- note that the Jupyter notebook workflows may need to be updated to account for these subdirectories. Within each of this subdirectories, there are further subdirectories for different models.
